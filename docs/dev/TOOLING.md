# Windows Developer Tooling

This document captures the supported local Windows tooling setup for Pizza Logs. It is meant for Neil's laptop and for Codex sessions running in `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs`.

## Quick Start

Open a fresh PowerShell terminal from the repo root:

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\PizzaLogs
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\dev\setup-tooling.ps1
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\dev\verify-tooling.ps1
```

After PowerShell 7 is installed, this also works:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\dev\verify-tooling.ps1
```

## What The Setup Script Does

`scripts/dev/setup-tooling.ps1` is idempotent. It:

- checks PowerShell, `winget`, Chocolatey, and Scoop;
- installs missing safe native tools with `winget` where possible;
- enables Corepack when Node supports it;
- installs the official Railway CLI with npm only if it is missing;
- adds common install directories to the **User** PATH only when those directories exist and are not already present;
- refreshes PATH for the current PowerShell session;
- prints next steps.

The script does not deploy, push to GitHub, modify secrets, or edit production Railway settings.

## Required Tools

The verification script treats these as critical:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `winget` | Official Windows package installation |
| `git` | Repository workflow |
| `gh` | GitHub auth and PR workflow |
| `node`, `npm`, `npx` | Next.js and TypeScript tooling |
| `pnpm` | Useful Node package manager compatibility |
| `python`, `pip` | Parser virtualenv and tests |
| `rg` | Fast text search |
| `fd` | Fast file search |
| `jq` | JSON inspection in scripts |
| `curl`, `tar`, `ssh` | Standard CLI utilities |
| `railway` | Railway status/link/deploy workflow, without auto-deploying |

Optional but useful tools checked by verification:

- `pwsh` for PowerShell 7
- `yarn`
- `vercel`
- `codex`
- `code`
- `wt`

`wt` is verified by PATH presence only. Windows Terminal opens a GUI Help/About dialog for some version-style invocations, so the verification script intentionally does not run `wt --version`.

## Current Audit Snapshot

As of the local audit on 2026-05-06:

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 is present.
- PowerShell 7.6.1 was installed.
- `winget` is present.
- Chocolatey and Scoop are not installed and are not required.
- Git for Windows is present.
- GitHub CLI is present at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`.
- GitHub CLI auth succeeds for the `CRSD-Lau` account.
- Node, npm, npx, pnpm, yarn, Python, pip, curl, tar, OpenSSH, Railway CLI, Vercel CLI, Codex CLI, VS Code CLI, and Windows Terminal are present.
- Standalone `ripgrep`, `fd`, and `jq` were installed with `winget`.
- The repo remote is `https://github.com/CRSD-Lau/Pizza-Logs.git`.
- The default working branch is `codex-dev`, tracking `origin/codex-dev`.
- The repo uses `package-lock.json`, so clean installs should use `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`.
- Railway CLI is installed, but the checkout is not linked. Run `railway link` only when intentionally working on Railway configuration.

## Node Project Notes

The repo has these core scripts:

```powershell
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run db:generate
npm run db:seed
npm run db:import-items
```

Use the local server launchers for day-to-day app work:

```powershell
C:\Projects\PizzaLogs\Start Pizza Logs Local.cmd
C:\Projects\PizzaLogs\Stop Pizza Logs Local.cmd
```

## Railway Rules

The verification script may run `railway status`, but it never deploys. Do not run deploy commands unless Neil explicitly asks.

Production deploys from `origin/main` after Neil merges a PR. Codex works on `codex-dev`, opens PRs into `main`, and does not push or merge `main` directly.
