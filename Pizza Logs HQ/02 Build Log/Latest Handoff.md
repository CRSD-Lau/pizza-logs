## What Was Done This Session

### Codex modernization and repository cleanup

- Created and committed modernization branch `codex/pizza-logs-modernization`.
- Removed tracked Claude-only artifacts:
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `.claude/launch.json`
  - stale Claude/Superpowers vault reference docs copied into the repo
  - stale `docs/superpowers` implementation plan/spec files
- Removed local Claude worktrees and stale generated/untracked artifacts after review.
- Converted vault AI-control docs to Codex-first docs:
  - `Codex Resume Prompt.md`
  - `Codex Prompts.md`
  - `Codex Gotchas.md`
  - `Codex Skills Index.md`
  - `Codex Skills and Plugins.md`
- Expanded `AGENTS.md` into the canonical Pizza Logs Codex guide covering parser safety, setup/dev/test/build commands, Railway expectations, Git hygiene, secrets, stale-code deletion rules, and Codex review rules.
- Added `docs/code-review.md` and updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, Railway/env docs, and vault links.

### Safety and hygiene fixes

- Admin auth now fails closed in production when `ADMIN_SECRET` is missing.
- Admin login now sets the admin cookie server-side as `HttpOnly`.
- Admin import/sync routes use shared `lib/admin-auth.ts`.
- `.env.example` now documents `ADMIN_SECRET` and the local-only `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=false` compose override.
- `.dockerignore` now excludes local agent dirs, combat logs, build/test caches, screenshots, and vault docs from Docker build context.
- `docker-compose.yml` parser service now builds from repo-root context so `parser/Dockerfile` paths resolve.
- `docker-compose.yml` now passes a local default `ADMIN_SECRET` and disables secure admin cookies for local HTTP compose, so compose remains usable with production-mode web builds while Railway production still requires an explicit secret and secure cookies by default.
- `package.json` lint script now uses ESLint CLI with `eslint.config.mjs`.
- Follow-up review fixes removed accidental `{` ignore patterns, fixed deleted vault links, and cleared `git diff --check` whitespace.

### Stale code removed

- Deleted deprecated Wowhead runtime enrichment module and tests:
  - `lib/wowhead-items.ts`
  - `tests/wowhead-enrichment-retry.test.ts`
  - `tests/wowhead-items.test.ts`
- Renamed the remaining numeric inventory-type helper from Wowhead-specific naming to generic item-template naming.
- Removed the duplicated `/parse-stream` line-count/progress block in `parser/main.py`; parser math/segmentation behavior was not changed.
- Updated stale guild roster admin test assertion to match the current userscript/admin panel UI.
- Renamed passive-heal parser tests so their names match the Skada-confirmed behavior: Judgement of Light, Vampiric Embrace, and Improved Leader of the Pack are included in healing totals.

### Maxximusboom missing from gear sync queue

Preserved the main-branch queue fix while merging modernization:

- `app/api/admin/armory-gear/missing/route.ts` no longer pre-limits player and roster candidate queries before filtering.
- The route still caps the final returned queue to `MAX_PLAYERS`.
- The regression keeps Maxximusboom visible even after many fresh cached players.

### Documentation sync after push

- Updated vault docs that still described pre-push work as incomplete.
- Moved admin auth, footer text, reset cleanup, and Gear Sync icon backfill into shipped/resolved docs.
- Updated Backlog, Feature Status, Technical Debt, Security Checklist, Known Issues, Now, and this handoff to reflect `origin/main` state.

## Verification

- Modernization branch gates before merge:
  - Parser tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` from `parser/` using bundled Python -> **123 passed**
  - TypeScript test sweep: `ts-node --project tsconfig.seed.json tests/*.test.ts` with JSX compiler options -> **13 passed**
  - Type check: `tsc --noEmit` via bundled Node -> **passed**
  - Lint: `eslint . --max-warnings=0` via bundled Node -> **passed**
  - Production build: `next build` via bundled Node after clearing generated `.next` cache -> **passed**
  - `git diff --check` -> **passed**
  - Secret scan found only placeholders/docs/local compose values; ignored local `.env.local` and `.env.sync-agent` were not staged.
- Docker/compose validation was not run because Docker is not installed on this machine.
- npm command validation was not run through `npm` because `npm` is not on PATH; equivalent bundled Node entrypoints were used.
- Main merge gates after conflict resolution:
  - Parser tests: **123 passed**
  - TypeScript test sweep: **14 passed** including `armory-gear-missing-route`
  - Lint: **passed**
  - Type check: **passed**
  - Production build: **passed with exit code 0**; Windows emitted a standalone trace warning because this worktree's `node_modules` is a junction to the other worktree. Railway's Linux build will install normal dependencies and should not hit that junction warning.
  - `git diff --cached --check`: **passed**
  - Staged secret scan found only placeholders/docs/local compose values.
- Push/deploy handoff:
  - `main` was pushed to `origin/main` at `3b98665`.
  - Live site returned HTTP 200 after push.
  - Railway CLI is not installed locally, so Railway deploy logs were not inspected from this machine.

## Current State

- `codex/pizza-logs-modernization` is committed at `2360f64`.
- `main` was pushed to `origin/main` at `3b98665`; this docs-only sync updates the vault after that push.
- Parser behavior is preserved; parser fixture suite passes.
- Railway deployment risk is low if production `ADMIN_SECRET` is configured and `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE` is not set to `false`.
- Existing Prisma migrations include historical migration `20260502120000_add_wow_items_remove_sync_jobs`, which drops `sync_jobs` if present; no new schema migration was added in this session.

---

## Exact Next Step

Manual production checks remain: confirm Railway Web Service has `ADMIN_SECRET`, inspect Railway deploy logs from a machine with Railway CLI/dashboard access, install or update Warmane Gear Sync `1.7.0`, run it once, then verify Maxximusboom and Lausudo gear icons.
