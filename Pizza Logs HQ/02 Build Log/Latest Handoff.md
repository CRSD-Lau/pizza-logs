# Latest Handoff

## Date

2026-05-05

## Branch

`codex-dev`

## Current State

- Pizza Logs is Codex-first: work happens on `codex-dev`, then PRs go into `main`.
- Railway production deploys from `main` after Neil merges a PR.
- Live app: https://pizza-logs-production.up.railway.app
- Local app target for Neil's laptop: http://127.0.0.1:3001
- Local Git executable fallback: `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe`
- GitHub CLI executable: `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`
- Parser correctness remains the highest-risk area.

## Current Implementation Snapshot

- Next.js app has public pages for upload, raids, sessions, encounters, bosses, leaderboards, players, guild roster, and weekly stats.
- `/uploads` and `/uploads/[id]` redirect to admin upload history; public raid/session pages use `/raids/...`.
- `/admin`, `/admin/uploads`, cleanup actions, and admin import APIs are protected by `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Upload flow streams multipart data from `app/api/upload/route.ts` to parser `/parse-stream`, then writes database rows and milestones.
- Parser supports both encounter marker and heuristic segmentation paths.
- Warmane heroic/Gunship behavior is handled with marker/session/crew-death evidence where available, but some cases remain impossible to prove from logs alone.
- Gear pages read cached Warmane snapshots, enrich from local AzerothCore `wow_items`, and attempt Warmane live fetches only as best effort.
- Supported roster/gear/portrait refresh path is browser-assisted userscripts from `/admin`.
- Production userscripts still post to Railway production; local userscripts post to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.

## Local Userscript Changes This Session

- Fixed a portrait userscript race where Wowhead/Zamimg modelviewer frames could load before the Warmane parent page wrote the character handoff into Tampermonkey storage. The frame now treats modelviewer pages as relevant immediately and retries for the handoff before giving up.
- Fixed a `/guild-roster` hydration mismatch caused by the Tampermonkey script adding `data-pizza-portrait-queued="1"` to server-rendered avatar nodes before React hydration. Queue state now stays in an in-memory `WeakSet` instead of the DOM.
- Bumped the portrait userscript to `0.5.2`.
- Added local install endpoints:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/armory-gear/userscript.local.user.js`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/guild-roster/userscript.local.user.js`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/player-portraits/userscript.local.user.js`
- Added local install buttons and URL fields on the admin gear/portrait and guild roster panels.
- Local gear and roster scripts still run on Warmane Armory pages, but they post imports into the laptop dev server instead of production.
- Local portrait script also matches `localhost:3001` and `127.0.0.1:3001` Pizza Logs pages.

## Recent Documentation Audit Changes

- Rewrote root README, contributor workflow, security policy, branch workflow docs, and review checklist around the current `codex-dev -> PR -> main` process.
- Removed duplicate or historical-only docs:
  - blank vault inbox capture note;
  - completed cinematic Superpowers spec and plan;
  - duplicate AI prompt/skill reference notes;
  - old growth/business note;
  - separate backlog and technical-debt docs now consolidated into `Feature Status`.
- Updated vault architecture, deployment, security, parser, current-focus, and known-issues notes to match current code.
- Corrected stale direct-`main` deploy language.
- Corrected stale claims that heroic and Gunship behavior are completely undetectable.
- Documented open repo issues found during audit: upload lacks hard server-side size enforcement, and some env/example variables had drifted from actual code usage.

## Verification This Session

PowerShell/npm shims in `node_modules/.bin` hit OneDrive reparse-point `Access is denied`, so equivalent bundled Node entry points were used for the same tools.

## Local Server Recovery

- A runtime error appeared on `http://127.0.0.1:3001`: `Cannot find module './5611.js'`.
- Root cause was a mixed `.next` cache: the running dev server loaded a webpack runtime expecting chunks at `.next\server\5611.js`, while the actual chunks were under `.next\server\chunks\5611.js`.
- Likely trigger: running a production `next build` while the long-running local dev server was still active.
- Recovery performed: stopped the stale Next process, removed only the generated `.next` folder, restarted the existing `PizzaLogsLocalTestServer` scheduled task, and verified `/` plus the local gear userscript endpoint returned 200.
- After the hydration fix build, the same generated-cache pattern briefly recurred with a missing `vendor-chunks/lucide-react.js`. Recovery was the same: fully stop repo Next processes, remove only generated `.next`, restart `PizzaLogsLocalTestServer`, then verify `/` and the local portrait userscript endpoint return 200.

## Exact Next Step

Push the updated `codex-dev` commit into draft PR #8, then have Neil update the portrait userscript from `/admin` after the PR is merged to `main`.
