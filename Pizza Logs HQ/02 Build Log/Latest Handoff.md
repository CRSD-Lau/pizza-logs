## Branch

`codex-dev`

## Current State

- Pizza Logs is Codex-first: work happens on `codex-dev`, then PRs go into `main`.
- Railway production deploys from `main` after Neil merges a PR.
- Live app: https://pizza-logs-production.up.railway.app
- Local app target for Neil's laptop: http://127.0.0.1:3001
- Local Git executable fallback: `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe`
- GitHub CLI executable: `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`
- Parser correctness remains the highest-risk area.

## Current Implementation Snapshot

- Next.js app has public pages for upload, raids, sessions, encounters, bosses, leaderboards, players, guild roster, and weekly stats.
- `/uploads` and `/uploads/[id]` redirect to admin upload history; public raid/session pages use `/raids/...`.
- `/admin`, `/admin/uploads`, cleanup actions, and admin import APIs are protected by `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Upload flow streams multipart data from `app/api/upload/route.ts` to parser `/parse-stream`, then writes database rows and milestones.
- Parser supports both encounter marker and heuristic segmentation paths.
- Warmane heroic/Gunship behavior is handled with marker/session/crew-death evidence where available, but some cases remain impossible to prove from logs alone.
- Gear pages read cached Warmane snapshots, enrich from local AzerothCore `wow_items`, and attempt Warmane live fetches only as best effort.
- Supported roster/gear refresh path is browser-assisted userscripts from `/admin`.
- Player avatars intentionally use class icons, with initials fallback when class data or icon loading is unavailable.
- Production userscripts still post to Railway production; local userscripts post to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.

## Class Icon Avatar Cleanup This Session

- Retired active Warmane/Wowhead/Zamimg portrait capture and standardized player avatars on built-in class icons.
- Removed the portrait install UI from `/admin`.
- Removed stale `portraitUrl` plumbing from player profiles, player lists, session pages, and roster rows.
- Replaced stale portrait parsing helpers with `lib/class-icons.ts`.
- Kept the old `/api/player-portraits/...` userscript URLs as no-op compatibility updates so existing Tampermonkey installs can self-update to harmless code.
- Bumped the no-op compatibility portrait userscript to `0.6.0`.
- Added local install endpoints:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/armory-gear/userscript.local.user.js`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/admin/guild-roster/userscript.local.user.js`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/player-portraits/userscript.local.user.js`
- Added local install buttons and URL fields on the admin gear and guild roster panels.
- Local gear and roster scripts still run on Warmane Armory pages, but they post imports into the laptop dev server instead of production.
- Local portrait script is compatibility-only and does not mutate Pizza Logs, Warmane, or modelviewer pages.

## Recent Documentation Audit Changes

- Rewrote root README, contributor workflow, security policy, branch workflow docs, and review checklist around the current `codex-dev -> PR -> main` process.
- Removed duplicate or historical-only docs:
  - blank vault inbox capture note;
  - completed cinematic Superpowers spec and plan;
  - duplicate AI prompt/skill reference notes;
  - old growth/business note;
  - separate backlog and technical-debt docs now consolidated into `Feature Status`.
- Updated vault architecture, deployment, security, parser, current-focus, and known-issues notes to match current code.
- Corrected stale direct-`main` deploy language.
- Corrected stale claims that heroic and Gunship behavior are completely undetectable.
- Documented open repo issues found during audit: upload lacks hard server-side size enforcement, and some env/example variables had drifted from actual code usage.

## Verification This Session

PowerShell/npm shims in `node_modules/.bin` hit OneDrive reparse-point `Access is denied`, so equivalent bundled Node entry points were used for the same tools.

## Local Server Recovery

- A runtime error appeared on `http://127.0.0.1:3001`: `Cannot find module './5611.js'`.
- Root cause was a mixed `.next` cache: the running dev server loaded a webpack runtime expecting chunks at `.next\server\5611.js`, while the actual chunks were under `.next\server\chunks\5611.js`.
- Likely trigger: running a production `next build` while the long-running local dev server was still active.
- Recovery performed: stopped the stale Next process, removed only the generated `.next` folder, restarted the existing `PizzaLogsLocalTestServer` scheduled task, and verified `/` plus the local gear userscript endpoint returned 200.
- After the hydration fix build, the same generated-cache pattern briefly recurred with a missing `vendor-chunks/lucide-react.js`. Recovery was the same: fully stop repo Next processes, remove only generated `.next`, restart `PizzaLogsLocalTestServer`, then verify `/` and local userscript endpoints return 200.
- During the class-icon cleanup, `next build` first compiled then hit stale `.next` route module state for admin API routes. Removing generated `.next`, rerunning the build, then restarting the local test server manually through `scripts/start-local-test-server.ps1` restored `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.

## Exact Next Step

Push the updated `codex-dev` commit into draft PR #8. After merge, no portrait userscript update is needed for normal use because class icons are built into the app; existing old portrait userscript installs can be removed, or allowed to auto-update to the no-op compatibility script.
