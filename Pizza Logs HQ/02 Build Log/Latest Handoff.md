## What Was Done This Session

### Gear icon backfill fix

**Problem:** Some player gear cards showed AzerothCore-enriched item details and GearScore, but still displayed the slot fallback badge instead of an icon. Example on Lausudo: `50024` Blightborne Warplate, `49964` Legguards of Lost Hope, `49985` Juggernaut Band.

**Root cause:** AzerothCore `item_template.sql` does not include icon slugs. Pizza Logs only had icons when Warmane/Tampermonkey supplied `iconUrl` or when `wow_items.iconName` had previously been seeded. The first fix re-queued iconless gear, but production still showed the same items because the hosted userscript only forwarded Warmane API JSON. When Warmane API omits an icon for a deterministic item, the browser still has the icon in the visible DOM, but Pizza Logs was not reading it.

**Changes:**
- `lib/warmane-armory.ts`
  - `gearNeedsEnrichment` now treats missing `iconUrl` as incomplete gear.
  - Added `collectWowItemIconBackfills` to extract Zamimg icon slugs from imported gear.
  - `writeCachedGear` now upserts `wow_items.iconName` from imported gear while preserving AzerothCore fields.
- `lib/armory-gear-client-scripts.ts`
  - Hosted userscript/bookmarklets now scrape current Warmane page item links/images as a fallback.
  - API equipment entries missing `icon`/`iconUrl` are patched by matching DOM item links by item ID.
  - Follow-up: bulk sync now fetches each queued player's Warmane summary HTML and scrapes that player's page icons before posting, so Neil does not need to visit each player one by one.
  - Userscript bumped to `1.7.0` so Tampermonkey can update.
- `tests/armory-gear-queue.test.ts`
  - Regression coverage: fully enriched-but-iconless cached gear goes back into the Warmane sync queue.
- `tests/warmane-armory-import.test.ts`
  - Regression coverage: Zamimg icon URLs produce reusable `wow_items.iconName` backfill rows.
- `tests/armory-gear-client-scripts.test.ts`
  - Regression coverage: generated userscript merges a DOM-derived icon URL into a Warmane API payload before posting to Pizza Logs.
  - Regression coverage: generated userscript fetches queued players' HTML pages and uses those page-specific icons during bulk sync.

## Verification

- `tests/item-template.test.ts` passed
- `tests/warmane-armory-cache.test.ts` passed
- `tests/warmane-armory-import.test.ts` passed
- `tests/armory-gear-queue.test.ts` passed
- `tests/armory-gear-client-scripts.test.ts` passed
- `tsc --noEmit` passed
- Non-stale test sweep passed with JSX-aware ts-node settings, excluding unrelated stale tests listed below.

Full ad hoc test sweep still has unrelated pre-existing test drift:
- `tests/guild-roster-admin-panel.test.ts` expects raw `guild_roster_members` text that current rendered markup no longer includes.
- Deprecated Wowhead tests (`tests/wowhead-enrichment-retry.test.ts`, `tests/wowhead-items.test.ts`) fail against old assumptions. Production gear enrichment no longer uses Wowhead.

## Current State

- **Live app:** https://pizza-logs-production.up.railway.app
- **Local branch:** `main`
- **Railway DB:** item `50024` exists with AzerothCore metadata; `iconName` still needs verification/backfill on production after deploy + browser sync.

## Exact Next Step

Deploy this fix, update/install Warmane Gear Sync userscript `1.7.0` from `/admin`, then run Warmane Gear Sync once from any Warmane character page. The script should fetch queued players' pages, merge page-specific icons, and populate missing `wow_items.iconName` values without visiting each player manually.
