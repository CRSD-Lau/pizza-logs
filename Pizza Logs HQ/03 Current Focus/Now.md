## Status

**HD cinematic intro is integrated on `codex/upload-cinematic-intro` and ready for live deployment.** The strip-derived previews were rejected as too low quality, so the approved direction uses a generated pre-rendered HD cinematic: ICC/WotLK-inspired frost-armored raid boss, blizzard approach, blue-eye reveal, close-up hold, and a clean fade into the real Pizza Logs page. The app now serves `public/intro/pizza-logs-cinematic-intro.webm`, MP4 fallback, and poster art. `FrozenLogbookIntro` plays the cinematic on hard page load, keeps `Skip`, exits on video end or after `5200ms`, and gives reduced-motion users the poster with a short `350ms` timeout.

**The old CSS-only intro is being superseded by the cinematic intro.** Production currently still has the earlier Frozen Logbook intro until this branch is pushed to `origin/main` and Railway deploys. The shared reveal animations for boss/player/leaderboard rows and `lib/ui-animation.ts` remain in place.

**Animation visibility follow-up is implemented.** After user feedback that the animation only flashed once and was not obvious, the follow-up makes the intro replay on every page change, makes shared reveal timing more visible (`420ms` / `70ms` stagger), includes Guild roster rows in the reveal wiring, and safelists `reveal-item` / `boss-reveal-item` so Tailwind keeps the shared animation CSS in production builds.

**Raid session boss display now preserves parsed timestamp order when available.** `orderBossDisplayEntries` sorts timestamped encounter rows by `startedAt` and falls back to the existing ICC progression helper only when timestamp/order data is unavailable. Leaderboard boss boards still use ICC progression order because they are aggregate boss boards, not a single timestamped raid session.

**Cinematic intro verification passed locally.** Focused red/green source test covers video sources, poster fallback, skip, reduced-motion handling, and removal of the old particle intro. TypeScript, ESLint, `git diff --check`, temp-copy `next build`, parser tests, local media route checks, and Edge headless screenshots passed. Browser review artifacts are under `tmp-mobile-check/hd_cinematic_intro/site_integration/`.

**Desktop checkout started clean from public `main`; animation work was developed on `codex/pizza-logs-animation-mvp` before main deployment.** The old `PizzaLogs-main-queue-fix` worktree folder and stale Git metadata are removed, the local modernization/Claude branches are deleted, and the remote `codex/pizza-logs-modernization` branch was deleted after confirming it matched `main`.

**Hunter weapon GearScore display/total is fixed.** Player gear cards now display raw per-item GearScore values through `displayItemScores`. Hunter-only melee/ranged GearScoreLite weighting was also removed from the total calculation because Notlich's in-game total (`6237`) follows the raw hunter weapon scores rather than counting heroic Scourgeborne Waraxes as `168` each. Titan Grip handling remains intact.

**AzerothCore ranged/relic inventory mapping is repaired.** `InventoryType` 25/26/28 now map to thrown/ranged-right/relic correctly, and migration `20260504120000_repair_wow_item_ranged_relic_equip_locs` repairs older `wow_items` rows affected by the previous shifted mapping.

**Codex modernization is live on `origin/main`, and the vault docs have been synced after the push.** The repo is Codex-first, tracked Claude-specific artifacts were removed, stale Wowhead runtime code was deleted, admin auth is safer in production, compose admin remains usable with local-only overrides, and the Maxximusboom missing-gear queue fix from main was preserved.

**ICC boss ordering is fixed in code for raid-session displays and leaderboards.** `lib/constants/bosses.ts` now owns the canonical Icecrown Citadel progression order plus normalization for common labels like Gunship variants, `Lich King`, and Blood-Queen Lana'thel variants. `/leaderboards` uses that shared sorter instead of alphabetical boss-name order, and raid session encounter displays use it while preserving duplicate pull order.

**Player profile Per-Boss Summary now uses the same ICC ordering.** `/players/<name>` no longer sorts summary cards by best DPS. The player page uses `buildPlayerPerBossSummary`, which groups player boss stats and applies the shared `sortByICCOrder` helper.

**Player Recent Encounters and weekly boss-kill cards now use ICC ordering too.** `/players/<name>` keeps the recent 20 encounter window but displays it in ICC progression order through `buildPlayerRecentEncounters`. `/weekly` and `/api/weekly` use `buildWeeklyBossKills`, so Boss Kills This Week no longer sorts by kill count.

**Codex should push validated work by default.** `AGENTS.md` now says Neil does not test local-only changes, so future change sessions should commit and push scoped work to Git unless Neil explicitly asks to keep it local. Deploy/live/main pushes still require the repo's normal validation gates.

**Favicon update is live on production.** `app/icon.svg` now uses the same SVG mark as the navigation logo, and `public/favicon.ico` fixes the legacy `/favicon.ico` 404 reported from production. After deploy, production returned HTTP 200 for both `/favicon.ico` and `/icon.svg`.

**Character portrait proof of concept now covers more UI surfaces and has a stricter rendered-face cache path.** Player initials render through `PlayerAvatar` on player profiles/lists, guild roster rows, session roster chips, and session player deep-dive headers. Portrait Userscript `0.5.0` runs on Pizza Logs, Warmane character pages, and Wowhead/Zamimg modelviewer frames, shares cache through Tampermonkey storage, rejects blank/black WebGL canvas captures through scratch-canvas pixel sampling, and can cache a static portrait or readable rendered canvas when the browser allows it. Direct local Warmane fetches and headless browser checks hit Cloudflare, so exact in-game faces remain browser-assisted.

**Warmane CDN gear icon mixed-content warnings are fixed in code.** Imported and cached gear icon URLs are normalized to HTTPS, including old `http://cdn.warmane.com/...` snapshots when gear slots are normalized for display.

**Global player search is implemented on the current branch.** The header search uses `/api/players/search?q=<query>`, merges combat-log `players` with PizzaWarriors/Lordaeron roster-only `guild_roster_members`, ranks exact matches first, and navigates to `/players/<name>`. It is debounced, cached client-side per query, and visible in the header on large and small screens.

**Local database downtime no longer breaks the main pages.** If Postgres is not running at `localhost:5432`, `/admin` and the main public pages still render the shared header/search and show Database unavailable warnings instead of the Next dev error overlay. The latest smoke check returned HTTP 200 for `/`, `/players`, `/raids`, `/leaderboards`, `/bosses`, `/guild-roster`, `/weekly`, `/admin`, and `/admin/login` with local Postgres offline, without misleading empty-data messages.

**Local PostgreSQL is installed and seeded on this machine.** PostgreSQL 16 is running as `postgresql-x64-16` on `localhost:5432`. The `pizzalogs` role/database exists, Prisma schema is pushed, bosses/realms are seeded, and `wow_items` has 38,610 imported AzerothCore item rows. The local DB is fresh, so players/raids/encounters remain empty until a combat log or Warmane roster is imported.
