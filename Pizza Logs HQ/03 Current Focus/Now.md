# Now

## Status
`v0.1.0` shipped. Wiki live. Railway deployed.
Public upload analytics have been moved into admin-only routes, and the mobile nav/raids/leaderboards pass is done.
Native Warmane Armory gear UI has been added to player profiles. Gear now has a DB-backed cache and a browser bookmarklet that bulk-imports missing players through Warmane's browser-accessible API.
