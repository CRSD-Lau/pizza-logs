# Now

## Status

**Hunter weapon GearScore display/total is fixed.** Player gear cards now display raw per-item GearScore values through `displayItemScores`. Hunter-only melee/ranged GearScoreLite weighting was also removed from the total calculation because Notlich's in-game total (`6237`) follows the raw hunter weapon scores rather than counting heroic Scourgeborne Waraxes as `168` each. Titan Grip handling remains intact.

**AzerothCore ranged/relic inventory mapping is repaired.** `InventoryType` 25/26/28 now map to thrown/ranged-right/relic correctly, and migration `20260504120000_repair_wow_item_ranged_relic_equip_locs` repairs older `wow_items` rows affected by the previous shifted mapping.

**Codex modernization is live on `origin/main`, and the vault docs have been synced after the push.** The repo is Codex-first, tracked Claude-specific artifacts were removed, stale Wowhead runtime code was deleted, admin auth is safer in production, compose admin remains usable with local-only overrides, and the Maxximusboom missing-gear queue fix from main was preserved.

**ICC boss ordering is fixed in code for raid-session displays and leaderboards.** `lib/constants/bosses.ts` now owns the canonical Icecrown Citadel progression order plus normalization for common labels like Gunship variants, `Lich King`, and Blood-Queen Lana'thel variants. `/leaderboards` uses that shared sorter instead of alphabetical boss-name order, and raid session encounter displays use it while preserving duplicate pull order.

**Player profile Per-Boss Summary now uses the same ICC ordering.** `/players/<name>` no longer sorts summary cards by best DPS. The player page uses `buildPlayerPerBossSummary`, which groups player boss stats and applies the shared `sortByICCOrder` helper.

**Codex should push validated work by default.** `AGENTS.md` now says Neil does not test local-only changes, so future change sessions should commit and push scoped work to Git unless Neil explicitly asks to keep it local. Deploy/live/main pushes still require the repo's normal validation gates.

**Favicon update is live on production.** `app/icon.svg` now uses the same SVG mark as the navigation logo, and `public/favicon.ico` fixes the legacy `/favicon.ico` 404 reported from production. After deploy, production returned HTTP 200 for both `/favicon.ico` and `/icon.svg`.

**Character portrait proof of concept now covers more UI surfaces and has a stricter rendered-face cache path.** Player initials render through `PlayerAvatar` on player profiles/lists, guild roster rows, session roster chips, and session player deep-dive headers. Portrait Userscript `0.5.0` runs on Pizza Logs, Warmane character pages, and Wowhead/Zamimg modelviewer frames, shares cache through Tampermonkey storage, rejects blank/black WebGL canvas captures through scratch-canvas pixel sampling, and can cache a static portrait or readable rendered canvas when the browser allows it. Direct local Warmane fetches and headless browser checks hit Cloudflare, so exact in-game faces remain browser-assisted.

**Warmane CDN gear icon mixed-content warnings are fixed in code.** Imported and cached gear icon URLs are normalized to HTTPS, including old `http://cdn.warmane.com/...` snapshots when gear slots are normalized for display.

**Global player search is implemented on the current branch.** The header search uses `/api/players/search?q=<query>`, merges combat-log `players` with PizzaWarriors/Lordaeron roster-only `guild_roster_members`, ranks exact matches first, and navigates to `/players/<name>`. It is debounced, cached client-side per query, and visible in the header on large and small screens.

**Local database downtime no longer breaks the main pages.** If Postgres is not running at `localhost:5432`, `/admin` and the main public pages still render the shared header/search and show Database unavailable warnings instead of the Next dev error overlay. The latest smoke check returned HTTP 200 for `/`, `/players`, `/raids`, `/leaderboards`, `/bosses`, `/guild-roster`, `/weekly`, `/admin`, and `/admin/login` with local Postgres offline, without misleading empty-data messages.

**Local PostgreSQL is installed and seeded on this machine.** PostgreSQL 16 is running as `postgresql-x64-16` on `localhost:5432`. The `pizzalogs` role/database exists, Prisma schema is pushed, bosses/realms are seeded, and `wow_items` has 38,610 imported AzerothCore item rows. The local DB is fresh, so players/raids/encounters remain empty until a combat log or Warmane roster is imported.
