# Now

## Status
`v0.1.0` shipped. Wiki live. Railway deployed.
Public upload analytics have been moved into admin-only routes, and the mobile nav/raids/leaderboards pass is done.
Native Warmane Armory gear UI has been added to player profiles. Gear now has a DB-backed cache and a browser bookmarklet that bulk-imports missing players through Warmane's browser-accessible API.
Gear items are enriched with Wowhead WotLK metadata when cached, giving the player page native icons, item quality, item level, and hover/focus tooltip details without making each item card link away.
The admin browser import queue includes older cached players whose gear is missing Wowhead details, so rerunning the bookmarklet upgrades existing cache rows too.
The bookmarklet now retries intermittent Warmane per-character failures and reports failed names; old bookmark URLs must be replaced after deploys because the code is copied into the bookmark.
