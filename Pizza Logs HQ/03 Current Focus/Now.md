## Status

**Codex modernization is live on `origin/main`, and the vault docs have been synced after the push.** The repo is Codex-first, tracked Claude-specific artifacts were removed, stale Wowhead runtime code was deleted, admin auth is safer in production, compose admin remains usable with local-only overrides, and the Maxximusboom missing-gear queue fix from main was preserved.
