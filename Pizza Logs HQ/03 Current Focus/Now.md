# Now

## Active Focus

Local development has moved from the OneDrive Desktop checkout to the GitHub-backed checkout at `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs`, while parser reliability remains the current product focus.

## Current Branch Rule

Codex works on `codex-dev`, pushes `origin/codex-dev`, and opens PRs into `main`. Codex does not push or merge `main` directly.

## This Session

- Created `docs/parser-audit.md` before changing parser behavior.
- Audited parser and upload code paths, including `/parse-stream`, parser core, persistence contracts, docs, and current tests.
- Studied local checkouts of `Ridepad/uwu-logs` and `bkader/Skada-WoTLK`; audit notes cite the relevant files/functions.
- Split combat-log tokenization into `parser/combat_log_events.py`.
- Split damage/healing extraction formulas into `parser/combat_metrics.py`.
- Refactored `parser/parser_core.py` to use those helpers while preserving existing result shapes.
- Added skipped-line accounting and aggregate parser warnings for malformed/truncated combat-log lines.
- Added `/parse-stream` filename validation for `.txt` and `.log` uploads.
- Preserved short explicit marker encounters that previously could be discarded by heuristic minimum-event filtering.
- Narrowed session difficulty normalization so heroic wipes do not promote a later normal kill unless there is direct evidence.
- Added focused parser tests for tokenization, damage, healing, malformed lines, explicit markers, heroic-to-normal fallback, and stream upload validation.
- Updated README, parser contract docs, parser architecture notes, security checklist, decision log, and known issues.
- Validation passed: full parser pytest suite, TypeScript type-check, ESLint, Next production build, and `git diff --check`.
- Set up and validated `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs` as the local working checkout.
- Copied local env files into the local checkout, installed dependencies, generated Prisma Client, and created a parser Python 3.12 virtualenv.
- Moved the Start/Stop launchers into `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs` and made them path-relative to the repo root.
- Verified `http://127.0.0.1:3001/` and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` from the new checkout.
- Imported 17 local Codex chats into `Pizza Logs HQ/08 AI Control Center/Imported Codex Chats/` so the new `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs` checkout carries the prior discussion history.
- Kept the import as readable vault digests, not raw JSONL; tool logs, encrypted reasoning payloads, and `.env*` contents were omitted.
- Ran an untracked secret-pattern scan against the imported notes after redaction.

## Open Follow-Ups

- Add hard server-side upload size enforcement.
- Decide whether app-level upload rate limiting is needed or Railway-level controls are enough.
- Continue using browser-assisted Warmane imports until a local automated sync agent is built.
- Absorbs remain future parser work.
- Add more encounter-specific useful-damage exclusions as real Skada comparison data becomes available.
- Add anonymized larger upload fixtures if Neil can provide safe samples.
- If the laptop port changes from `3001`, add matching local roster/gear userscript variants or update the local constants.
- If the local launchers need edits, update `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs\Start Pizza Logs Local.cmd` and `C:\Projects\PizzaLogs\Stop Pizza Logs Local.cmd`.
- If DB-backed local routes return 500, start PostgreSQL service `postgresql-x64-16` from an elevated shell or by running the Start launcher as administrator.
